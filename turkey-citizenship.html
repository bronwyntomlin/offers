			  <p><strong>If you purchase real estate in Turkey that is worth at least $400,000 USD, you can apply for Turkish Citizenship by Investment and obtain a Turkish Passport.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Along your application, your spouse and any children under the age of 18 will also be granted citizenship.</strong></p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Apply for Turkish Citizenship by Investment</strong></h2>
			  <p>In June 2022, the government announced changes to their Turkish Citizenship by Investment Programme, sometimes called Turkey Golden Visa. These changes mean that buyers can obtain citizenship and a passport from as little as $400,000
				USD. This has made the programme one of the most affordable and attractive citizenship initiatives around the world. Since then, thousands of investors have obtained citizenship through purchasing real estate, with Property
				Turkey helping many.
			  </p>
			  <p>Those who are successful in their application, will have Turkish citizenship forever and any children born after will be born as citizens. Turkey allows dual nationality, allowing you to keep multiple citizenships alongside your
				Turkish one.
			  </p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h2><strong>Different ways to obtain Turkish Citizenship by Investment</strong></h2>
			  <p>1 &ndash; Acquire real estate investment worth at least $400,000 USD. The cheapest option</p>
			  <p>2 &ndash; Make a fixed capital investment of at least $500,000 USD in Turkey</p>
			  <p>3 &ndash; Bank deposit into a Turkish Bank at least $500,000 USD or equivalent foreign currency</p>
			  <p>4 &ndash; Acquire Government Bonds of at least $500,000 USD or equivalent foreign currency</p>
			  <p>5 &ndash; Create jobs for at least 50 people in Turkey as attested by the Ministry</p>

			  <p><br></p>
			  <h2><strong>Requirements for Real Estate Investment Programme</strong></h2>
			  <p>- Applicants need to purchase a property that is worth at least $400,000 USD. This does not need to be a single unit, it can be multiple units, with provisions of regulations.</p>

			  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Turkish Citizenship by Investment FAQ&rsquo;s</strong></h2>
			  <p style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>How long does it take to obtain Turkish Citizenship?</strong></h3>
			  <p>In Property Turkey&rsquo;s experience, it normally takes between 2 &ndash; 4 months to complete the process for our clients to obtain Turkish Citizenship by Investment program. This process is a lot quicker than other countries
				around the globe which can take years.
			  </p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>Can my children and dependents obtain citizenship?</strong></h3>
			  <p>Yes. If you purchase a property worth $400,000 USD, you can obtain citizenship and a Turkish passport for yourself, your spouse, and children under 18 years of age. Any kids that are over 18 will need to purchase real estate in
				their own name worth $400,000 USD.
			  </p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>After I have Turkish Citizenship and passport, do I need to live in Turkey?</strong></h3>
			  <p>No. You do not need to live in Turkey in order to keep your citizenship and passport. There are no minimum required days per year that you have to stay in Turkey. Your Citizenship is yours for life.</p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>Do I have to give up my birth citizenship in order to become a Turkish citizen?</strong></h3>
			  <p>No. You do not have to give up the citizenship of your birth in order to become a Turkish citizen because Turkey allows its citizens to keep dual nationality and passports.</p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>Will my Turkish Citizenship expire at some point?</strong></h3>
			  <p>Your citizenship will never expire. Once you have completed the process and held your property for a minimum of three years, your citizenship is guaranteed forever. This is the same for your spouse and any children include within
				your application.
			  </p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>Do I need to learn Turkish to get a Turkish passport?</strong></h3>
			  <p>While other citizenship programs and countries require you to pass a language test in order to obtain a passport, Turkey does not. You do not need to learn Turkish in order to apply for a passport. However, if you choose to live
				in Turkey permanently, it is highly recommended to learn the basics of the language in order to easily integrate into life within the country.
			  </p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>How strong is a Turkish passport? How many countries can I travel to?</strong></h3>
			  <p>Having a Turkish passport provides visa-free access to more than 100 countries around the world. These countries include: Japan, South Korea, South America, and more. Someone with a Turkish passport can also travel relatively easily
				to the USA, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and European Union countries. <strong>NOTE</strong>: A Turkish passport is renewable every ten years.
			  </p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>Relocating to the UK or USA</strong></h3>
			  <p>As a Turkish national, you can apply for a Business Person visa to live and eventually obtain British citizenship. You can also apply for the E-2 Investor Visa to help relocate to the USA. If you dream of living in the UK or USA,
				Turkish Citizenship can be the gateway.
			  </p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>Do I need to declare my wealth to Turkish authorities?</strong></h3>
			  <p>No. Turkish tax authorities will not ask you any questions regarding your current financial status or existing assets.</p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>Are there tax implications I should know about?</strong></h3>
			  <p>As of 2022, Turkey has double taxation agreements with most countries throughout the developed world. Therefore, if you have paid taxes on your income earned from outside of Turkey, it is unlikely that you will be taxed again by
				the Turkish government. For more information, contact us to speak with a Turkish tax expert.
			  </p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>Are there any nationals who cannot apply for Turkish Citizenship?</strong></h3>
			  <p>Under current Turkish law, there are citizens of certain countries that are prohibited from applying for Turkish Citizenship by Investment. Presently, these are nationals of the following countries: Armenia, Cuba, North Korea,
				and Syria.
			  </p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>Can I work in Turkey if my application is successful?</strong></h3>
			  <p>Yes. Those who apply for citizenship and obtain it, are then free to work in Turkey without the need of a work permit. Citizenship makes it easier to work in Turkey.</p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>Do I need to undertake Military Service?</strong></h3>
			  <p>No. Applicants who have invested in Turkey and obtained their citizenship are exempt from mandatory military service. This also includes your dependents who have applied alongside you.</p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>What are the inheritance laws of Turkey?</strong></h3>
			  <p>Turkish law fully protects its citizens and legal heirs in the unfortunate event of a death. Under Turkish law, your property and investment will smoothly pass down to your loved ones without much red tape.</p>
			  <p><br></p>
			  <h3><strong>Can I pay using a currency that is not Turkish Lira?</strong></h3>
			  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: As of January 2022, buyers can no longer deposit money straight into the account of the seller. Instead, foreign buyers are now required to send their funds to a Turkish bank prior to purchasing a property.
				The bank will then exchange the currency via Turkey&apos;s Central Bank rate into Turkish Liras for the purchase.
